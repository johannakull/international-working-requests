# International Working Request Calculator

This is a personal Python project that helps manage international working periods in accordance with company policies for international working requests.

### Features
- **Calculate the submission deadline** for an international working request based on the desired start date.
- **Check eligibility** of a proposed international working period in relation to existing periods.
- **Record new international working periods** and store them in a CSV file.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create an empty CSV file called "international_working_days.csv" in the root of the repository.
3. Adjust the constants in the constants.py file according to your companyâ€™s international working request policies (e.g., minimum notice days, lookback period).
4. Make sure you have the required dependencies (`dateutil` library) installed:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dateutil
5. Run the program by executing `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
